    <h1>Welcome to Part 8: Your JavaScript Level One Project!</h1>

    <p>For this project you will be building a generic website that will seem toask mundane questions to normal users, but you secretly are looking fora spy! Anyone visiting your website will be asked a series of questions,only the Spy will be able to give
        specific answers you expect. If allquestions are answered correctly, you will post a secret message in consolefor the Spy to read!
    </p>
    <p>Here are the four conditions you will check for the spy:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The Spy has the same first letter of her First Name and Last Name</li>
        <li>The Spy is between the Age of 20 and 30 (exclusive of 20 and 30)</li>
        <li>The Spy is at least 170 centimeters tall.</li>
        <li>The Spy has a pet name that ends with the letter "y".</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We are going to leave this project a little more open-ended, but if youfeel like you need more guidance, check out the solution walkthrough videos!But believe it or not, we've actually covered everything you need to know tocomplete this task. I would
        suggest you use Javascript to prompt the user forinformation and set these to variables. Then use these variables to check forthe four conditions to all be true. It's up to you what the secret message is!
    </p>
    <p>A spy with the following information should see your secret message:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>26 years old</li>
        <li>175 cm tall</li>
        <li>Pet name is "Sammy"</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Keep in mind you can ask the question prompts in whatever order you want,you can even separate asking for first name and then another prompt for last name Also remember to switch out the script src to your own .js file!Right now it's connected to
        Part8.js which contains the solutions
